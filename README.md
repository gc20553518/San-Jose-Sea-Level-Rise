Project Overview
This GIS project analyzes the projected impacts of sea level rise in the San Jose / South Bay region using NOAA flood raster data.
Flooding was modeled under three scenarios:
* 3 ft rise
* 5 ft rise
* 10 ft rise
Each scenario was visualized in QGIS to understand which neighborhoods, cities, and shorelines are at future risk.

Data & GIS Methods
Data Sources
* NOAA Sea Level Rise raster dataset
* Google Satellite basemap
* City boundary shapefiles

GIS Workflow
1: Loaded DEM + water-level rasters into QGIS
2: Extracted 3ft, 5ft, and 10ft flood zones
3:Applied symbology for each layer
4: Overlaid flood layers on satellite imagery
5: Added city boundary polygons and labels
6: Exported final maps
7: Wrote analysis report

Key Results
3 ft Sea Level Rise
* Flooding limited to wetlands and ultra-low elevations
* Minimal impact to developed areas

5 ft Sea Level Rise
* Floodwaters begin reaching neighborhoods near the shoreline
* Higher-risk zones appear along the Bay edge

10 ft Sea Level Rise
* Major areas including:
  * Alviso
  * Sunnyvale
  * Mountain View
  * Palo Alto
  * NASA Ames
  experience significant flooding
* The South Bay shoreline shifts dramatically
 Even small sea level increases cause large nonlinear expansions of flood zones.

Skills Demonstrated
1: Working with raster + vector layers
2: Understanding CRS and spatial alignment
3: Hazard and environmental visualization
4: Interpreting spatial risk patterns
5: Real-world NOAA data usage
6: Clear communication of GIS findings

This project shows:
✔ Real spatial analysis (not just coursework)
✔ Climate change & environmental relevance
✔ Raster analysis and flood modeling
✔ Scenario comparison
✔ Professional GIS workflow
✔ A meaningful, real-world application
